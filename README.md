Week 1 Makers Academy

Task:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TFL wants to create a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use.
For this we are requested to create a program that will run all Docking stations,
simulate all bikes and emulate all the infrastructure required for this Project.

User Stories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.
